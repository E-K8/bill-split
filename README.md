# Bill Splitter

This app is created during BAE Systems hackathon:

Hackathon Brief
Today is your chance to come together as a group to showcase your teamwork and development skills and build an application that solves a real world problem and uses technology to make a difference in the world.
The outcome from your hackathon should be:
A minimum viable product (MVP) showcasing an innovative full stack application which meets the need youâ€™ve identified
A five minute presentation, complete with how you worked as a team and a demonstration of the project

The app lets housemates split bills for common expenditures.
